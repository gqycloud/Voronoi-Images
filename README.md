# Voronoi-Images
Python script for processing voronoi diagrams out of images. 
Process as follows: 

1) Read Image
2) Use various feature detection algorithms from the OpenCV library to process feature points
3) Generate voronoi facets from feature points
4) Average out the color within each feature facet to create abstract tesselations

Example:
